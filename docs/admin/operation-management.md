# Operations Management

Under operations management, the school administrator can manage all the various applications submitted by prospective students, all student records and activities, as well as the curriculum used in teaching the students in the school.

## Prospective Students Applications

Under Prospective Students Applications, the administrator manages the various applications submitted by all prospective students, sorted out by year and class.

The administrator can choose to reject or accept any given application based on the person's input and documents submitted.

Next, all accepted applications are pushed into the admission page for final assessment before admission is given to the prospective student.

The above step is added as a stepping stage to either **screen** prospective students based on another criteria or "examination" to generate a more qualified system of admission.

## Student's Admission

Under Student's Admission, the administrator manages all the **accepted** applications submitted by the prospective students, sorted out by year and class, before admission is granted to them.
